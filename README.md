# React-Piano-Keys

Welcome to my mini-piano created through React! This is a simple interactive application in which you as the user can play the piano. Simply click on any of the keys and you have just become a electronic pianist! As a musician who enjoys playing piano covers, I have provided a couple sample songs that I have coded and figured out by ear.


## Notable Features

- Click to play piano keys
- Sample songs that highlight keys being played in real-time
